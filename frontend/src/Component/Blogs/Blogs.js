                  <h3>Books as Traveling Companions</h3>
                  <p>
                    It's holiday season, and for a lot of us, that means travel.
                    For goodness sake, don't buy a book at an airport unless it
                    is a true emergency. Be prepared. Buy your travel books
                    used. You want them entertaining enough to distract you from
                    the hassles of getting to your destination, and you also
                    want them lightweight and disposable so that you can leave
                    them behind if you need more room in your luggage.

                  <p>
                    Maddie arrived one morning to find an astrology book wide
                    open on the floor in front of Biography. She knew it hadn't
                    been there when she closed the night before.I once stood at
                    the counter and witnessed a historical romance (involving
                    men in kilts, if you must know) come straight off the shelf
                    by a good two inches and then plummet to the floor.

                  <h3>The Warmth of Children's Classics</h3>
                  <p>
                    It's the dark time of year, and you know what that means:
                    going to bed early to read! Like many of you, I have a pile
                    of books on my bedside table, and I read more than one at a
                    time. Before bed, I like witty fiction and fascinating
                    science or history. And now until at least Groundhog Day,
                    I'm ending each night's reading session with an excerpt from
                    my favorite children's stories.

                  <p>
                    Every time February comes around, all the red, pink, and
                    white Valentine's Day gifts are thrown into the front lines,
                    promise love and romance, and we, the heartbroken and
                    lonely, can only turn our heads, wipe away the tear that
                    falls unexpectedly, and hope no one notices our dire
                    state.There's hope, however, for in the midst of all candy
                    hearts and monogrammed sweets, there are books, countless
                    books, that will have our backs.

                  <p>
                    Books for taller people have been moved downstairs.
                    Biography, History, Science, Reference, and Foreign Language
                    are now downstairs in the back corner where Kids used to be.
                    Young Adult has moved into the main room where Horror was.
                    Horror is where Kids Beginning Chapter Books were. You get
                    the idea. Saturday, November 25 is Small Business Saturday,
                    and we are running a Buy 3 Get 1 Free special. Your friendly
                    booksellers are always ready to help you find your next
                    read, wherever it is.
